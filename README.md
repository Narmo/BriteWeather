BriteWeather is a simple OS X menubar application for presenting current weather conditions.

## Data

This application uses data from OpenWeatherMap. In order to use their API properly you need to get your own APPID key (http://openweathermap.org/appid) and set it in BriteWeather-Prefix.pch file:

```objective-c
#define APPID @"<your own APPID goes here>"
```
